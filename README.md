### AI-Based Iris Recognition System Using Python
## Overview

This project implements an AI-based iris recognition system using Python and OpenCV. The system captures images of the iris, preprocesses them, segments the iris region, extracts unique features, and matches them to identify individuals. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for biometric identification.
Features

  Image acquisition from a camera.
  Preprocessing to enhance image quality.
  Pupil and iris segmentation.
  Feature extraction using ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF).
  Iris matching using BFMatcher.
